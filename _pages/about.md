#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

My name is Fuzhong Zhou and I am currently a fifth year Ph.D. student at Columbia University department of Industrial Engineering and Operation Research (IEOR), under the advisory of [Prof. Daniel Lacker](https://www.columbia.edu/~dl3133/). My research lies in probability theory in continuous time stochastic analysis; more specifically, I am interested in interacting particle systems, sampling and differential game theory.

I completed my master's degree in computational finance at Carnegie Mellon University, and my bachalor's degree in applied mathematics at Central University of Finance and Economics in China.
